# file-run2 [Reverse Engineering] [100 Points] #

## Description ##
Another program, but this time, it seems to want some input. 
What happens if you try to run it on the command line with input "Hello!"?
Download the program [here](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/156/run).

## Hints ##
1. Try running it and add the phrase "Hello!" with a space in front (i.e. "./run Hello!")
